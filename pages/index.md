# Goals of the Competition

* To promote and encourage creativity and musicality.

* To promote the use of Open Source software for music production and composition and the awesome
[Open Source software synthesizers](http://linuxsynths.com) available for everyone, in particular
the [FM synthesizers we have selected](/fmsynths/) to be used for the competition.

* To encourage learning of the principles and application of sound synthesis among musicians, in
particular synthesis methods beyond the traditional subtractive synthesis, in this case
[FM synthesis](https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/introduction-frequency-modulation).

* To help broaden the audience for Open Source musicians.

* To encourage a culture of sharing and to catalyze the generation of original, liberally licensed
material (e.g. audio tracks, stems, presets, project files etc.) for the free and remix culture.

* And last, but certainly not the least, to hear some awesome music!


# Prizes

* We have an awesome sponsored prize for the winner of the competition. Check out the
  [Prizes](/prizes) page for details.

* Of course, the winner also receives eternal glory in the eyes of the Open Source Music community
  and the incredible feeling of achievement and creative satisfaction!

* Also, the winner entry, and the second and third placements will be presented at the second
  [Sonoj Convention](https://sonoj.org/) in Cologne on the weekend after the voting has finished
  (27./28.10.2018)!

* We will work with Open Source community sites to promote the contest as a whole and the winning
  entry in particular.

* If you want to sponsor a prize, please get in [contact](mailto:fmchallenge@osamc.de) with the
  organizer of the competition. Please note that we can't ship physical prizes, so vouchers for
  online (music) shops, trainings, mixing and mastering services, or services related to the
  promotion of the competition entries or the contestants would probably work best. But we're open
  to hear your ideas!
