> *Let's make some awesome Open Source music!*

**What:**

1. Make a music track, adhering to the following rules:
    1. The track should be *in-the-style-of* a well-known artist or song of your choosing
       (but not a cover, remix or blatant copy).
    2. It must incorporate a recording of a physical sound source, which *you made yourself*
       (e.g. you playing an instrument or singing, or a field recording, etc.).
    3. You may use *only Open Source software* (proprietary DAWs are allowed as an exception).
2. [Upload](https://archive.org/create/) it to archive.org under a Creative Commons license, and
3. [Submit it](/submit/) into the competition.

**Before you enter the competition, be sure to check out [the detailed rules](/rules/)!**

**When:** The competition starts on **September 19th, 2019** and runs for one month until the end
of **October 19th, 2019**.

**Who:** **Everybody** (i.e. every natural person) can enter the competition. The tools to use are
[Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and getting started with
[music production using Open Source software](https://libremusicproduction.com/) is easy and
free to everyone!

**Winning:** The winner of the competition is selected by **general vote**. [Voting](/vote/) starts
on **October 20th, 2019** and is open for **seven days**. The entry receiving the most points wins
and will be presented at the third [Sonoj Convention](https://sonoj.org/), which takes place on the
weekend of October 26th / 27th in Cologne. Second and third places will be awarded as well. We
do not give out physical prizes, but the winners will get [free mastering](/prizes) of one or more
of their songs and, of course, will receive fame and glory :) and the community as a whole also
wins!

Please share this announcement to all interested parties. If you wish to sponsor prizes for the
competition winners, please [contact](mailto:challenge@osamc.de) the organizers!


# Goals of the Competition

* To promote and encourage creativity and musicality.

* To promote the use of Open Source software for music production and composition and the awesome
Open Source software [synthesizers](http://linuxsynths.com/) and
[effect](https://wiki.thingsandstuff.org/Effects)
[plugins](http://linux-sound.org/linux-vst-plugins.html) available for everyone.

* To encourage learning of the principles and application of sound design, recording and mixing
  techniques among musicians.

* To help broaden the audience for Open Source musicians.

* To encourage a culture of sharing and to catalyze the generation of original, liberally licensed
  material (e.g. audio tracks, stems, presets, project files etc.) for the free and remix culture.

* And last, but certainly not the least, to hear and enjoy some awesome music!


# Prizes

* The winners of the first, second and third prize get a free mastering of one or more of their
  songs. For details see the [prizes page](prizes).

* There are no monetary or physical prizes.

* Of course, the winner receives eternal glory in the eyes of the Open Source Music community
  and the incredible feeling of achievement and creative satisfaction!

* Also, the winning entry, and the second and third placements will be presented at the third
  [Sonoj Convention](https://sonoj.org/) in Cologne on the weekend where the voting period ends
  (26./27.10.2019)!

* We will work with Open Source community sites to promote the contest as a whole and the winning
  entry in particular.

* If you want to sponsor a prize, please [get in touch](mailto:fmchallenge@osamc.de) with the
  organizer of the competition. Please note that the organizers can't ship physical prizes, so
  shipping would have to be part of the sponsorship as well. We think that vouchers for online
  (music/equipment) shops, trainings, mixing and mastering services, or services related to the
  promotion of the competition entries or the contestants would probably work best. But we are open
  to hearing your ideas!
