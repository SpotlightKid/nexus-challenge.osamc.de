While we hope that the main motivation to take part in the competitiom is to
have fun in the creation of music, we are happy to have found a generous
prize sponsor.

is offering *free mastering* for the winners of the challenge.

### 3rd prize

One (1) song mastered!


## Award Ceremony

The winners of the first, second and third prize will be announced on Sunday,
the 27th at the [Sonoj Convention](https://sonoj.org/schedule.html) and their
fame and glory spread over the internets.


## How to Redeem Prizes

The winners of the challenge will be contacted by the organizers via the
email address given to create the account for the submission of their entry.
They should then contact Samuel Aubert within two weeks of this notice to
