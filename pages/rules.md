Every competition needs some rules, so does this one. These are here to make this actually a
challenge, but also to make it easier for everyone to maneuver it and to provide a level playing
field. Beyond these rules, above all, we hope you have fun and contribute to a *culture of fairness
and sharing*!

**Note:** These rules *may* be amended if deemed necessary before the start of the competition, so
be sure to check them again before you start with your entry!

The competition is organized by the [Open Source Audio Meeting Cologne](https://osamc.de),
represented by its member **Christopher Arndt**.

# A. Submission Rules

**Update 2018-09-15:** clarified rules 9 and 10.<br />
**Update 2018-09-18:** added *ADLplug* to the list of allowed synthesizers.

1. To enter the competition you **MUST** create an audio track (aka a "piece"), upload the audio
file to [archive.org](https://archive.org/create/) and submit the link to the track via the
submission form ([https://fmchallenge.osamc.de/submit/](https://fmchallenge.osamc.de/submit/))
between the start of the competition (**15.09.2018 00:00:00 UTC**) and before the dead line for
submission (**14.10.2018 23:59:59 UTC**). Every person can enter the competition with
**one entry** only. The representative of the competition organizer is excluded from entering the
competition.

2. Your audio track **MUST** be downloadable without access control and the audio file **MUST** be
**FLAC encoded** and **properly tagged** with (at least) **artist name**, **track title**, **year**
(2018) and "Open Source Music FM Synthesizer Challenge" as the **album title**. The audio **MUST**
be **stereo** and have a sampling rate of **44100 Hz** and **16 bits** per sample.

3. The length of your submitted audio file **MUST** be **no less than one (1) minute** and **no
more than five (5) minutes**.

4. Your audio track **MUST** be created specifically for this competition, not released elsewhere
before, and the composition **SHOULD** be a new one (we know we can't check this, but please be
honest).

5. You **MUST** license your audio track under a [Creative Common
license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) ([CC
BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) or more permissive).

6. You **MAY** use **ONLY** the following software synthesizers as sound generators (in
alphabetical order):

    * [6PM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mv-6pm/) by Michel Vergnaud
    * [ADLplug](https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug) by Jean Pierre Cimalando
    * [Dexed](http://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) by Pascal Gauthier et al.
    * [DX10](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/) by mda
    * [Hexter](http://smbolton.com/hexter.html) by Sean Bolton
    * [JuceOPLVSTi](https://bsutherland.github.io/JuceOPLVSTi/) by Bruce Sutherland
    * [OpulenZ](http://linuxsynths.com/OpulenZPatchesDemos/opulenz.html) by the
      [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) project
    * [Oxe FM Synth](https://oxesoft.wordpress.com/) by Oxesoft (Daniel Moura)

7. You **MAY** use as many instances of the above synthesizers as you need.

8. You **MAY** use any other Open Source (see below under "Open Source Conformance") audio
plug-ins, which **do not generate audio on their own**, e.g. effects like chorus, delay, reverb,
distortion, etc. or MIDI and control signal generators and processors, but you **MAY NOT** use
**any other software or hardware**, which is capable of generating audio independently of its audio
input.

9. You **MAY NOT** use **any samples or recordings** (not even for e.g. drums or vocals), but you
   **MAY** freeze or bounce tracks to an audio file to save CPU processing power.<br/>
   **To clarify:** no vocals are allowed (unless you synthesize them with FM). The reason is that this
   competition is about showing your skills with synth sound programming and production. Usually a
   vocal track has a big impact on the listening experience and not everybody has the voice/talent
   to lay down a good vocal performance (or access to someone possessing it).<br>
   Also, you may not sample single sounds of the allowed FM synthesizers and load them into a
   sampler and sequence them. Recordings are only allowed to bounce a whole track or a sequence
   to audio to save processing power.

10. You **MAY** use non Open Source Software for recording, sequencing, mixing, mastering and
    preparing the audio track for upload, as long as you follow all the other rules, particularly
    rule *A.6* and *A.8*.<br/>
    **To clarify:** if you use a non-OS DAW, you may only use the following types of non-open
    source signal processors within the DAW: gain, panning, delay, reverb, eq, compressor and
    limiter. These may be built-in or proprietary plugins, which come with the DAW, when purchased.
    Any other proprietary plug-ins are *not* allowed.

11. When submitting your entry, you **MUST** list all plug-ins you used for creating your track and
also any other sequencing, recording and mastering software you used. The competition organizer
**MAY** request access to our project files if there is a reasonable suspicion that you did not
follow rules *A.6* to *A.10*.

12. To be eligible for winning, you **MUST** vote on the other submissions into the competition
(see below under "Voting Rules"). If you don't vote, your submission **will be disqualified**.

13. Your track **SHOULD** be a **musical piece** in the broadest sense (e.g. including ambient,
soundtrack, abstract music etc.) and **MAY** be in any genre you want. The only guideline here is
to try to please the audience.

14. You **SHOULD** make the patches you created for the synthesizer(s) and other plug-ins, which
you used for your track, available for download, preferably under a permissive license or public
domain. Doing so *is not* a requirement for being eligible for winning the competition.

# B. Open Source Conformance

1. Software regarded as Open Source **MUST** be **released** under and **conform** to one of the
licenses listed on [https://opensource.org/licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).

2. This means (but is not limited to) that the source code for the software **MUST** be freely
downloadable and distributable according to the rules of the license.

3. The software **SHOULD** be packaged for a current version of a major Linux distribution or
available as a binary installer for Linux from the software's creator or third-parties (so that
everybody has a realistic chance of using the same software).

# C. Voting Rules

1. The voting period starts immediately **after the final submission date** for competition entries
(see rule *A.1*) and lasts for **ten (10) days** until **24.10.2018 23:59:59 UTC**.

2. Voting is open to every person (except the representative of the competition organizer, see
rule *A.1*), contestants **MUST** vote to be able to win.

3. Everybody has **one vote**, which consist of **fifteen (15) points** distributed across five (5)
competition entries, where one entry gets five (5) points, another four (4) points, and so on, down
to one (1) point.

4. The vote may be changed (but not retracted completely) as often as desired during the voting
period.

5. Voters must go to [https://fmchallenge.osamc.de/vote/](https://fmchallenge.osamc.de/vote/) and
provide a **valid email address**, which will be validated during the voting process by sending a
personalized confirmation link to said email address. The voter must open this link to get access
to the voting form. This link may also be used to change the vote until the end of the voting
period. The email address will not be used for other purposes.

# D. Winning Rules

1. Only those contestants can win, which are not disqualified by the competition organizer due to
not adhering to the rules.

2. The contestant who gets the most points wins. In case of a tie, the entry which has the most
four and five points per individual vote wins.

3. Second and third place are awarded according to the same rules, where the loser of a tie from a
higher tier takes precedence over the next lower tier.

4. The final decision in case of disputes lies with the competition organizer.
