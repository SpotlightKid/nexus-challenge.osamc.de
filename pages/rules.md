Every competition needs some rules, so does this one. These are here to make this actually a
challenge, but also to make it easier for everyone to maneuver it and to provide a level playing
field. Beyond these rules, above all, we hope you have fun and contribute to a *culture of fairness
and sharing*!

**Note:** These rules *may* be amended if deemed necessary before the start of the competition, so
be sure to check them again before you start with your entry!

The competition is organized by the [Open Source Audio Meeting Cologne](https://osamc.de),
represented by its member **Christopher Arndt**.

**Update 2019-09-20:** changed submission deadline to be the end of 2019-10-19.<br />

# A. Submission Rules

1. To enter the competition you **MUST** create an audio track (aka a "piece"), upload the audio
   file to [archive.org](https://archive.org/create/) and submit the link to the track via the
   submission form ([https://nexus-challenge.osamc.de/submit/](/submit/)) between the start of the
   competition (**19.09.2019 00:00:00 UTC**) and before the dead line for submission
   (**19.10.2019 23:59:59 UTC**).

2. Every person can enter the competition with **one entry** only. You may submit your entry under
   a pseudonym or using your real name, but you must supply a valid email address to identify
   yourself to the site and allow the organizers to contact you during the competition and for the
   announcement of the winners.

3. Your audio track **MUST** be downloadable without access control and the audio file **MUST** be
   **FLAC encoded** and **properly tagged** with (at least) **artist name**, **track title**,
   **year** (2019) and "Open Source Music Nexus Challenge" as the **album title**. The audio file
   **MUST** be **stereo** and have a sampling rate of **44100 Hz** and **16 bits** per sample.

4. The length of your submitted audio file **MUST** be **no less than one (1:00) minute** and **no
   more than five (5:00) minutes**.

5. Your audio track **MUST** be created specifically for this competition, not released elsewhere
   before, and the composition **SHOULD** be a new one (we know we can't check this, but please be
   honest).

6. You **MUST** license your audio track under a
   [Creative Common license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)
   ([CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) or more permissive).

7. Your track **SHOULD** be a **musical piece** in the broadest sense (e.g. including ambient,
   soundtrack, abstract music etc.) and **MAY** be in any genre you want.

8. Your track **SHOULD** be **in the style of** a well-known artist or song, but not be a cover,
   remix or direct copy. I.e. you **SHOULD NOT** copy any harmonic or melodic material of an
   existing song without alteration or giving it a new context and rather copy the structure and/or
   sonic landscape of your source. Think of your track as an **homage** or a musical
   **[pastiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche)**.

9. Your track **MUST** incorporate at least one recording of a physical sound source, which you
   made yourself. This may be a recording of you playing an instrument, singing, or banging on
   your kitchen pots and tools, or a field recording of your environment, etc. In addition, you
   **MAY** use other, pre-recorded samples, for example for drums or sampled instruments, provided
   they are compatible with the license of your track as required by rule 6.

10. You **MAY** only use Open Source software (see below under "Open Source Conformance") in the
    creation process. This includes (but is not limited to) tasks such as recording, sequencing,
    mixing, mastering and preparing the audio track for upload (e.g. encoding and tagging).
    Absolutely no proprietary, non-Open Source plug-ins are allowed.

11. The following exceptions to rule 10. are granted:

    * You **MAY** use hardware devices to make digital recordings of physical audio sources or to
      transfer analog recordings into the computer (e.g. field recorders, smart phones, digital
      recorders, ADAT converters, etc.)

    * You **MAY** use proprietary DAW software (e.g. *REAPER*, *Bitwig*, *Tracktion* and similar
      products). But you **MAY NOT** use any of the included plugins, unless they are Open Source
      or are necessary for the signal flow (e.g. Send/Return plugins in Tracktion).

12. When submitting your entry, you **MUST** list all plug-ins you used for creating your track and
    also any other sequencing, recording and mastering software you used. The competition organizer
    **MAY** request access to our project files if there is a reasonable doubt that you followed
    the rules properly.

13. To be eligible for winning, you **MUST** vote on the other submissions into the competition
    (see below under "Voting Rules"). If you don't vote, your submission **will be disqualified**.

14. You **SHOULD** make the patches you created for the synthesizer(s) and other plug-ins, which
    you used for your track, available for download, preferably under a permissive license or
    public domain. Doing so *is not* a requirement for being eligible for winning the competition.


# B. Open Source Conformance

1. Software regarded as Open Source **MUST** be **released** under and **conform** to one of the
   licenses listed on [https://opensource.org/licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).

2. This means (but is not limited to) that the source code for the software **MUST** be freely
   downloadable and distributable according to the rules of the license.

3. The software **SHOULD** be packaged for a current version of a major Linux distribution or
   available as a binary installer for Linux from the software's creator or third-parties (so that
   everybody has a realistic chance of using the same software).


# C. Voting Rules

1. The voting period starts immediately **after the final submission date** for competition entries
   (see rule *A.1*) and lasts for **seven (7) days** until **26.10.2019 23:59:59 UTC**.

2. Voting is open to every person, contestants **MUST** vote to be able to win.

3. Everybody has **one vote**, which consist of **fifteen (15) points** distributed across five (5)
   competition entries, where one entry gets five (5) points, another four (4) points, and so on,
   down to one (1) point.

4. The vote may be changed (but not retracted completely) as often as desired during the voting
   period.

5. Voters must go to [https://nexus-challenge.osamc.de/vote/](/vote/) and provide a
   **valid email address**, which will be validated during the voting process by sending a
   personalized confirmation link to said email address. The voter must open this link to get
   access to the voting form. This link may also be used to change the vote until the end of the
   voting period. The email address will not be used for other purposes.


# D. Winning Rules

1. Only those contestants can win, which are not disqualified by the competition organizer due to
   not adhering to the rules.

2. The contestant who gets the most points wins. In case of a tie, the entry which has the most
   four and five points per individual vote wins.

3. Second and third place are awarded according to the same rules, where the loser of a tie from a
   higher tier takes precedence over the next lower tier.

4. The final decision in case of disputes lies with the competition organizer.
