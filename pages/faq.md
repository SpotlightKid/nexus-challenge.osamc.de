Here we will answer questions, which we receive, and whose answers we deem important to or
interesting for all participants.


**Q:** Why is it called the "Nexus Challenge"?

**A:** Because it is [the year 2019](https://youtu.be/-fu7jN2_2pE?t=179) and the task is to
*replicate* something.

**Q:** Are collaborations or group entries or contributions from others allowed?

**A:** Yes, collaborations with and contributions from other people are allowed. Collaborators
and / or contributors must be specified in the notes when submitting the entry.

entrant.

and ideas with other participants?
